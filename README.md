## Introduction
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. They need help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy.

The purpose of this assessment was to optimised the customer's datasets, analyse and present insights and findings.


## Dataset

The dataset was gotten from [here](https://cdn-assets.theforage.com/vinternship_modules/kpmg_data_analytics/KPMG_VI_New_raw_data_update_final.xlsx). A quick visual assessment using Google Sheet revealed that the three datasets we would be working with were present in different tab, so I proceeded to download these three datasets as a CSV.

I assessed the 3 datasets extracted from the provided sheet.
1. Customer Demographic
2. Customer Address
3. Transactions Data in the past 3 months
